## Maker's Statement

### Selecting a topic

“To” is confusingly versatile. Describing the things that “to” can be within a sentence would result in [a tall list](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/to). As a preposition, it can detail for whom or where an action is taken, and as an infinitive, it can replace other parts of speech. In Whitman’s *Leaves of Grass*, he uses phrases expressively to describe his environment and the actions he takes in it.

Whitman’s usage of “to” ranges in complexity from a 2-gram describing a single thing to an entire sentence making a statement about natural or societal phenomena. In this visualization, I attempted to illustrate the frequency of the former. My project focuses on an audience similar to me — I have not read *Leaves of Grass*, acknowledging this by conveying a set of statistics distanced from the text.

## Visualization

The resulting visualization contains a select 20 2-grams starting with “to.” Each blinks on and off corresponding to how often they appear in the text. For example, “to me” turns on and off approximately twice a second, whereas “to die” does the same in 13 seconds. Text in green represents prepositions, and text in blue represents infinitives. The part of speech of each phrase is identified manually and thus may be incorrect.

Elements on the page have little context. This is intentional. Despite the page not being conducive to a better understanding of the content of the viewer. Instead of attempting to interpret and display meaningful, complete ideas, I wanted to break down the book into a description of the relations that Whitman takes to his environment.

Instead of attempting to interpret and display meaningful, complete ideas, I wanted to break down the book into a description of the relations that Whitman takes to his environment.

Using these tools, I encountered barriers in how accurately the timings for each phrase were displayed. Initially, I wanted some randomness in the time it takes for the words to blink, representing the different ways one could look at the text and the reality of missing a few words while reading. Ultimately, this choice was made for me through the speed of the website and the limitations of playing 20 videos simultaneously. This combines the viewer’s perception of time into a curated viewpoint of frequency that varies among people.

## Commentary

I made interpretive choices in filtering and cleaning the data, picking only the most commonly appearing phrases, and merging synonyms. Additionally, the order of each block is skewed from a natural descending order of frequency, instead being grouped by similar subjects.

Though I wish I could have included every point of data, it would place a focus on the less frequent albeit equally important other “to-” phrases, perhaps inviting too deep of an analysis of the text. Instead, portions of this visualization are rooted in naivete toward the text, intending to preface a direction to which this text may lead.
